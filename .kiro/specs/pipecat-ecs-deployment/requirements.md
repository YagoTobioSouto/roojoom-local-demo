# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves deploying the Pipecat-based voice AI agent solution to AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) to enable scalable, cloud-based deployment with Twilio phone integration. The current solution runs locally using Python, FastAPI, Pipecat framework, Daily WebRTC, and Amazon Nova Sonic. The deployment will transform this into a production-ready containerized service running on AWS infrastructure, extended with Twilio voice calling capabilities to handle both WebRTC and traditional phone calls through the same AI agent.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the Pipecat voice AI agent to AWS ECS, so that I can run the service in a scalable cloud environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ECS service is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a containerized version of the Pipecat application
2. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL expose the FastAPI server on the configured port
3. WHEN users access the service THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as the local version
4. WHEN multiple users connect simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent sessions through ECS scaling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper AWS infrastructure configuration, so that the service runs securely and efficiently in the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to ECS THEN the system SHALL use AWS Fargate for serverless container management
2. WHEN configuring networking THEN the system SHALL use VPC with proper security groups
3. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL use AWS Secrets Manager for API keys and credentials
4. WHEN configuring load balancing THEN the system SHALL use Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated deployment and infrastructure management, so that I can deploy and maintain the service efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use AWS CDK or CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code
2. WHEN building containers THEN the system SHALL use AWS CodeBuild or GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. WHEN updating the service THEN the system SHALL support rolling deployments with zero downtime
4. WHEN monitoring the service THEN the system SHALL integrate with CloudWatch for logging and metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration, so that I can deploy to different environments (dev, staging, prod).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration
2. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL use different secret stores per environment
3. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL have environment-appropriate resource limits
4. WHEN accessing the service THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific domain names

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the deployed service to maintain all existing functionality, so that the cloud version works identically to the local version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to the service THEN the system SHALL support Daily WebRTC integration
2. WHEN using voice features THEN the system SHALL integrate with Amazon Nova Sonic
3. WHEN calling functions THEN the system SHALL support weather API and other function calls
4. WHEN managing sessions THEN the system SHALL handle bot process lifecycle in containerized environment

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper security controls, so that the deployed service follows AWS security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running containers THEN the system SHALL use non-root users and minimal base images
2. WHEN handling network traffic THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS/TLS encryption
3. WHEN accessing AWS services THEN the system SHALL use IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials
4. WHEN storing logs THEN the system SHALL ensure sensitive data is not logged in plaintext

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Twilio inbound calling capabilities, so that users can interact with the AI agent through traditional phone calls for testing purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls the Twilio phone number THEN the system SHALL answer the call and connect to the Nova Sonic AI agent
2. WHEN handling inbound calls THEN the system SHALL process voice audio through Twilio Media Streams and Nova Sonic
3. WHEN managing call sessions THEN the system SHALL handle multiple concurrent phone calls alongside WebRTC sessions
4. WHEN testing functionality THEN the system SHALL support the same AI capabilities (weather queries) through voice

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Twilio webhook integration, so that the system can handle inbound call events and media streaming properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving Twilio webhooks THEN the system SHALL return proper TwiML responses to establish media streams
2. WHEN a call is initiated THEN the system SHALL connect the caller to the media stream WebSocket endpoint
3. WHEN handling media streams THEN the system SHALL process real-time audio bidirectionally with Nova Sonic
4. WHEN calls end THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and log call events

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper Twilio configuration management, so that phone integration works securely across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific Twilio credentials
2. WHEN storing Twilio secrets THEN the system SHALL use AWS Secrets Manager for API keys and tokens
3. WHEN configuring webhooks THEN the system SHALL use environment-appropriate callback URLs
4. WHEN handling phone numbers THEN the system SHALL support different Twilio numbers per environment

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless voice interaction through phone calls, so that I can access the same AI capabilities as web users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN speaking during a phone call THEN the system SHALL process speech through Nova Sonic with the same quality as WebRTC
2. WHEN using function calls THEN the system SHALL support weather queries through phone interface
3. WHEN experiencing call issues THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback responses
4. WHEN testing the system THEN the system SHALL maintain call quality and responsiveness

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic call monitoring, so that I can troubleshoot and verify phone integration functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calls are processed THEN the system SHALL log call events and basic metrics
2. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs of call flows and errors
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into call success/failure rates
4. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL log sufficient information to debug issues
